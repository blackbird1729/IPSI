This is the code repository for the paper IPSI: Enhancing Structural Inference with Automatically Learned Structural Priors.
IPSI is a general framework for enhancing structural inference and can be applied to various structural inference models.
As examples, we implemented two IPSI-enhanced versions respectively for NRI and MPM.
